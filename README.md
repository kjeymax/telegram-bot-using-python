One of the more well-known instant messaging (IM) platforms today is Telegram because it lets you store messages in the cloud rather than just on your device and has good cross-platform compatibility. You can use Telegram on Android, iOS, Windows, and pretty much any other platform that can support the web version. The process of creating a chatbot on Telegram is extremely straightforward and only needs a few quick steps. The chatbot functions both independently and within Telegram groups and channels.

- Reply Buttons
